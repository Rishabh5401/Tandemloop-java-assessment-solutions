# Java Coding Assessment

This repository contains solutions to the 4 logic problems.

## Coding Language
* **Language:** Java
* **Version:** Java 8+

## Files Description

### Problem-1.java
**Calculator:** A program that uses a `Calculator` class to perform Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division based on user input.

### Problem-2.java
**Number Series I:** Generates a series of odd numbers (1, 3, 5...) based on the input integer `a`. If `a = 4`, it generates the first 4 odd numbers.

### Problem-3.java
**Number Series II:** Generates a series of odd numbers, but adjusts the count if the input is even.
* Input `a = 5` (Odd) -> generates 5 numbers.
* Input `a = 4` (Even) -> generates 3 numbers (same as `a-1`).

### Problem-4.java
**Multiples Count:** Analyzes a list of numbers and outputs a dictionary (Map) containing the count of numbers divisible by 1 through 9.

## How to Run
